## 💫 What is the Floorp Project?
<strong> " The Floorp project is a project that seeks privacy and a balance between anonymity and the public nature of the web."</strong>

The Floorp browser is based on Firefox, but delivers a completely different experience from Firefox, with a Chromium-like UI and features.
